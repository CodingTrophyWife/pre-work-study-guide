          <li>DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF (DRY) is a coding princple that encourges developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>

          <li>git checklist -b branch name: creates a new branch and switches to it 
          <li>Repository ("repo"): Every project on GitHub is called a respository. A folder for your project that contains all the files and their revision history.</li>
          <li>Branch: Workspace where you can make changes that dont affect the live site. Create a new branch for your work, and name it to best describe the work (Example:"Content-3-26")</li> 
          <li>Markdown(.md): The way content files are formatted in GitHub. A way to write for the web using plain text; easily converts to HTML. Markdown files use .md file extention.</li>
          <li>Commit changes: Saving a new version of a file you're working on. Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file, you're making a commit. Adds changes to your branch.</li>
          <li>Pull Request ("PR"): Asking for changes on a branch to merge into another branch. Way to discuss and review your work with others.</li>
          <li>Merge: When a PR is approved, changes are "Pulled in" or merged into main branch. Changes publish/deploy to the live site once this hasppens.</li>
          <li>Issue: Way to report new tasks or content fixes. Track progress on project board.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks</li>
          <li>console.log: console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code. .log(), is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
          <li>if statement is a way of introducing decision making into our code. The if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>===: Checks to see if two values are equal,  are returns a boolean result true if the valuses are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>Array: is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>for loop: uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements:
            <ol>
              <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable X and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0), as shown in the following line of code:
                    var X = 0;</li>
              <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable X is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the length built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition, as shown in the following line of code:
                    X < shapes.length;</li>
              <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code X++ is a shortcut way of writing X+1. Now everytime the code loops, X will increase by 1, as shown in the following line of code:
                    X++</li>  
              </ol>         
          </li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses. Then we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform. </li>
